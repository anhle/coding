    "1. The simple idea, for a given range of bars, the maximum area can either from left or right half of the bars, or from the area containing the middle two bars. For the last condition, expanding from the middle two bars to find a maximum area is O(n), which makes a typical Divide and Conquer solution with T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n). Thus the overall complexity is O(nlgn) for time and O(1) for space (or O(lgn) considering stack usage).\n",

    "The areas in left and right of minimum value bar can be calculated recursively. If we use linear search to find the minimum value, then the worst case time complexity of this algorithm becomes O(n^2). In worst case, we always have (n-1) elements in one side and 0 elements in other side and if the finding minimum takes O(n) time, we get the recurrence similar to worst case of Quick Sort.\n",

    "**Range minimum query (RMQ)** solves the problem of finding the minimal value in a sub-array of an array of comparable objects\n",
    "1. A simple solution is to run a loop from qs to qe and find minimum element in given range. This solution takes O(n) time in worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Another solution is to create a 2D array where an entry [i, j] stores the minimum value in range arr[i..j]. Minimum of a given range can now be calculated in O(1) time, but preprocessing takes O(n^2) time. Also, this approach needs O(n^2) extra space which may become huge for large input arrays.\n",

    "Also assume in the optimal solution those m task A are done at a series of time points of a1, a2 ... ax, and n task B are done at a series of time points of b1, b2 ... by and we know that b1 < a1.\n",

Now if we swap a1 and b1, a2 and b2 ... ak and bk, it will still be a valid solution since the separation between ak and ak+1 (if exists) becomes even larger.

But we need to ensure that the heapification occurs only after the intervals of cooling time, nn, as done in the last approach.\n",

    "To do so, firstly, we put only those elements from mapmap into the queuequeue which have non-zero number of instances. Then, we start picking up the largest task from the queuequeue for current execution. (Again, at every instant, we update the current timetime as well.) We pop this element from the queuequeue. We also decrement its pending number of instances and if any more instances of the current task are pending, we store them(count) in a temporary temptemp list, to be added later on back into the queuequeue. We keep on doing so, till a cycle of cooling time has been finished. After every such cycle, we add the generated temptemp list back to the queuequeue for considering the most critical task again.\n",

    "First consider the most frequent characters, we can determine their relative positions first and use them as a frame to insert the remaining less frequent characters. Here is a proof by construction:\n",

    "Imagine task A appeared 4 times, others less than 4. And n=2. You only need to arrange A in the way that doesn't violate the rule first, then insert other tasks in any order:\n",

    "Now if we have more than one tasks have the same max occurrence, the scheduling will look like this:\n",
    "A B - A B - A B - A B\n",
