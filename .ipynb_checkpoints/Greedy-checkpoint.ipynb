    "## 621. Task Scheduler\n",
    "Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: tasks = [\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\"], n = 2 Output: 8 Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach 1 Greedy with sorting Greedy order--> sort The idea of greedy algorithm is at each time point we choose the task with most amount to be done and is also at least n apart from the last execution of the same task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a proof of the correctness: --> ordering correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "At some time, task A has the most remaining amount to be done and A is also at least n apart from its most recent execution. However, suppose the optimal solution doesn't choose A as the first task but rather chooses B. Assume we have x task A remain and y task B remain, we know x >= y. Also assume in the optimal solution those m task A are done at a series of time points of a1, a2 ... ax, and n task B are done at a series of time points of b1, b2 ... by and we know that b1 < a1. Further, we assume k is the largest number that for all i <= k, bi < ai. Now if we swap a1 and b1, a2 and b2 ... ak and bk, it will still be a valid solution since the separation between ak and ak+1 (if exists) becomes even larger. As to bk, it's the previous ak and bk+1 > ak+1 > ak(prev) + n = bk(now) + n.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we proved that no solution will better than schedule A first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach 2 Greedy with priority-queue Instead of making use of sorting as done in the last approach, we can also make use of a Max-Heap(queuequeue) to pick the order in which the tasks need to be executed. But we need to ensure that the heapification occurs only after the intervals of cooling time, nn, as done in the last approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, firstly, we put only those elements from mapmap into the queuequeue which have non-zero number of instances. Then, we start picking up the largest task from the queuequeue for current execution. (Again, at every instant, we update the current timetime as well.) We pop this element from the queuequeue. We also decrement its pending number of instances and if any more instances of the current task are pending, we store them(count) in a temporary temptemp list, to be added later on back into the queuequeue. We keep on doing so, till a cycle of cooling time has been finished. After every such cycle, we add the generated temptemp list back to the queuequeue for considering the most critical task again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep on doing so till the queuequeue(and temptemp) become totally empty. At this instant, the current value of timetime gives the required result. Approach 3\n",
    "\n",
    "First consider the most frequent characters, we can determine their relative positions first and use them as a frame to insert the remaining less frequent characters. Here is a proof by construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine task A appeared 4 times, others less than 4. And n=2. You only need to arrange A in the way that doesn't violate the rule first, then insert other tasks in any order: A - - A - - A - - A It's obvious that we need 6 other tasks to fill it. If other tasks are less 6, we need (4 - 1) (n + 1) + 1 = 10 tasks in total, if other tasks are equal to or more than 6, tasks.length will be our result. Now if we have more than one tasks have the same max occurrence, the scheduling will look like this: A B - A B - A B - A B So we only need to modify the formula by replacing 1 with the different amount of tasks that has the max occurrence: (4 - 1) (n + 1) + taskCountOfMax = 11"

    "\n",
    "Let's construct the answer digit by digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current answer is say, 123, and the next digit is 5, then the answer must be at least 123555...5, since the digits in the answer must be monotonically increasing. If this is larger than N, then it's impossible.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each digit of N, let's build the next digit of our answer ans. We'll find the smallest possible digit d such that ans + (d repeating) > N when comparing by string; that means d-1 must have satisfied ans + (d-1 repeating) <= N, and so we'll add d-1 to our answer. If we don't find such a digit, we can add a 9 instead.\n",

    "**Approach 2** Truncate After Cliff\n",

    "\n",
    "One initial thought that comes to mind is we can always have a candidate answer of d999...9 (a digit 0 <= d <= 9 followed by some number of nines.) For example if N = 432543654, we could always have an answer of at least 399999999. We can do better. For example, when the number is 123454321, we could have a candidate of 123449999. It seems like a decent strategy is to take a monotone increasing prefix of N, then decrease the number before the \"cliff\" (the index where adjacent digits decrease for the first time) if it exists, and replace the rest of the characters with 9s.\n",
    "\n",
    "When does that strategy fail? If N = 333222, then our strategy would give us the candidate answer of 332999 - but this isn't monotone increasing. However, since we are looking at all indexes before the original first occurrence of a cliff, the only place where a cliff could exist, is next to where we just decremented a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can repair our strategy, by successfully morphing our answer 332999 -> 329999 -> 299999 with a linear scan.\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll find the first cliff S[i-1] > S[i]. Then, while the cliff exists, we'll decrement the appropriate digit and move i back. Finally, we'll make the rest of the digits 9s and return our work\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. case 1: 14267 , we see that inversion happens at 4. In this case, then answer is obtained by reducing 4 to 3, and changing all the following digits to 9. => 13999\n",
    "\n",
    "1. case 2: 1444267, here eventhough the last inversion happens at the last 4 in 1444, if we reduce it to 3, then that itself breaks the rule. So once we find the last digit where inversion happens, if that digit is repeated, then we have to find the last position of that digit. After that it is same as case1, where we reduce it by 1 and set the remaining digits to 9.\n",
    "=> 1399999\n",
    "\n",
    "We can prove our algorithm is correct because every time we encounter a cliff, the digit we decrement has to decrease by at least 1.
