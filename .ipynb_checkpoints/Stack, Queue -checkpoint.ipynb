    "A stack is simply a data structure in which the most recently added elements are removed first. Can you simulate a single stack using an array? If we're okay with simply allocating a fixed amount of space for each stack, we can do that. This may mean though that one stack runs out of space, while the others are nearly empty.\n",

    "If you want to allow for flexible divisions, you can shift stacks around. Can you ensure that all available capacity is used?\n",

    "## 3.2 Stack Min: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the minimum element doesn't change very often. It only changes when a smaller element is added, or when the smallest element is popped.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we kept track of extra data at each stack node? What sort of data might make it easier to solve the problem?\n",
    "> One solution is to have just a single int value, minValue, that's a member of the Stack class. When minV alue is popped from the stack, we search through the stack to find the new minimum. Unfortunately, this would break the constraint that push and pop operate in O( 1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we kept track of the minimum at each state, we would be able to easily know the minimum. Consider having each node know the minimum of its \"substack\" (all the elements beneath it, including itself).Then, to find the min, you just look at what the top element thinks is the min.\n",
